# 🧭 GridGlyph Roadmap: Build a Symbolic Transformation Language

## 🎯 Goal
Build a **symbolic transformation language** that allows LLMs to:
- See transformations across many symbolic variants
- Invent and reuse their own visual grammar
- Apply logic without relying on numbers or natural language
- Eventually solve puzzles using only internal symbolic logic

This roadmap focuses on the **transformation language layer**, not just grid mapping.

---

## 📦 Phase 1: Define Symbolic Grammar Framework

### Step 1: Split Glyphs into Two Layers
| Layer | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ✅ `grid_glyphs` | Represent cell values in input/output grids (no meaning) |
| ✅ `op_glyphs` | Represent operations like tile, mirror, rotate |

Example:
```json
{
  "grid_glyphs": ["🜀", "🜁", "🜂", "🜃", "🜄", "🜅", "🜆", "🜇", "🜈", "🜉"],
  "op_glyphs": {
    "tile_horizontal": "🜊",
    "mirror_rows": "🜌",
    "shift_down": "🜐",
    "append_input": "🜒"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Create Symbol Set Registry
- Store glyph sets with descriptions
- Track which are best for mirroring, movement, classification

---

## 🔁 Phase 2: Prompt LLM to Learn Symbolic Logic

### Step 3: Build Few-Shot Prompt Templates
Use multiple symbolic views of same puzzle  
→ teach LLM to see transformation patterns

Prompt format:
```plaintext
Below are several symbolic grid transformation examples.

Each uses unique characters from different visual styles.

Study each pair carefully and describe the transformation using symbolic logic only.

Then apply the same transformation to the final test input.

Example:

Input:
🜀 🜁
🜂 🜃

Output:
🜀 🜁 🜀 🜁 🜀 🜁
🜂 🜃 🜂 🜃 🜂 🜃
🜁 🜀 🜁 🜀 🜁 🜀
🜃 🜂 🜃 🜂 🜃 🜂
🜀 🜁 🜀 🜁 🜀 🜁
🜂 🜃 🜂 🜃 🜂 🜃

Symbolic Rule:
T = [🜊(R0), 🜊(R1), 🜌(🜊(R0)), 🜌(🜊(R1)), R0, R1]

Apply this rule style to the following test input.
```

---

## 🧩 Phase 3: Let LLM Invent Its Own Rules

### Step 4: Ask LLM to Use Only Glyphs from Op Glyph List
Inject op glyph dictionary at start of prompt:
```plaintext
🜀–🜉 → represent grid values  
🜊 = repeat horizontally  
🜌 = mirror alternate rows  
🜑 = shift down  
🜒 = append original again  
```

Ask:
> “Describe the transformation using only these symbols.”

Let the model begin to build its own grammar.

---

## 🔄 Phase 4: Reinforce Symbol Stability Across Puzzles

### Step 5: Track Symbol Usage Per Session
Create a memory cache that stores what each symbol meant previously.

Example:
```python
{
  "🜊": "tile_horizontal",
  "🜌": "mirror_rows",
  "🜀": "row_0",
  "🜁": "row_1"
}
```

Before prompting → inject this into the prompt.

Example reinforcement:
```plaintext
Previously:
🜊 = tile horizontal
🜌 = mirror rows
🜀 = row 0
🜁 = row 1

Now apply the same logic here.
```

---

## 🧪 Phase 5: Evaluate Symbol Reuse and Stability

### Step 6: Run Multiple Examples Using Same Symbols
Let the model see the same transformation expressed with:
- Different glyph sets
- Same op glyphs (`🜊`, `🜌`, etc.)

Track how consistently it applies those op glyphs across puzzles.

If unstable → try new prompts  
If stable → extract symbolic rule  
If incorrect → change symbol set and re-prompt

---

## 🧬 Phase 6: Build Internal DSL from Symbolic Rules

### Step 7: Parse Symbolic Output Into Structured Logic
Convert symbolic expressions into an internal DSL:

```python
def parse_symbolic_rule(rule):
    return {
        "operations": [
            {"op": "tile", "axis": "horizontal", "factor": 3},
            {"op": "mirror", "rows": [2, 3]},
            {"op": "append", "source_rows": [0, 1]}
        ]
    }
```

Eventually, this becomes your **symbolic execution engine**.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 7: Convert Symbolic Rules to Python Functions

### Step 8: Write Code Synthesizer
Take symbolic rules and convert them into real Python functions.

Example input:
```plaintext
T = [🜊(R0), 🜊(R1), 🜌(🜊(R0)), 🜌(🜊(R1)), 🜊(R0), 🜊(R1)]
```

Synthesize:
```python
def transform(grid):
    r0 = grid[0] * 3
    r1 = grid[1] * 3
    return [
        r0,
        r1,
        r0[::-1],
        r1[::-1],
        r0,
        r1
    ]
```

---

## 🛠️ Phase 8: Feedback Loop with Re-Mapping

### Step 9: If Rule Is Ambiguous → Try New Glyph Set
If the LLM gives inconsistent output:
- Change symbol mapping
- Ask again using emoji or arrows instead of katakana
- Observe if logic stabilizes

This mimics how humans reframe problems until pattern clicks.

---

## 🧠 Phase 9: Teach LLM to Inherit Meaning Through Exposure

### Step 10: Expose to Many Variants Until Stable
Once the model sees enough variation:
- It begins to treat `🜊` as repeat
- Treat `🜌` as mirror
- Recognize patterns across puzzles

Eventually, you can ask:
> “Apply the same rule using these new symbols.”

And the LLM will:
🧠 Understand the structure  
🔁 Apply the same logic  
🔄 Keep symbolic meanings consistent

---

## 🧮 Phase 10: Once Stable — Use Symbolic Logic Alone

### Step 11: Stop Generating Python Functions
When symbolic grammar matures:
- Ask LLM to return only symbolic logic
- Don’t show code anymore
- Just give new input and say:  
> “Apply the same transformation using symbolic logic only.”

Now the LLM is solving puzzles via **its own invented visual calculus**.

# 📊 Final Thought

You're building something revolutionary:
> A system where AI learns to reason visually through abstract symbols  
→ invents its own transformation language  
→ stabilizes it over time  
→ and eventually solves puzzles using only symbolic inference

This is not just puzzle-solving —  
It's **AI-native visual reasoning**, built from scratch.
