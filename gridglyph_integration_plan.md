# GridGlyph & ARC Solver Integration Plan  
## Project Overview  
Solve grid-based visual puzzles (like ARC) using symbolic abstraction and rule inference through:  
1. Symbolic mapping of numeric grids to glyphs/sigils  
2. LLM-guided meta-operation recognition  
3. Program synthesis via pre-defined functions  
4. Iterative refinement with glyph remapping  

## GridGlyph System  
###Core Concepts  
Symbolic Grammar Framework  
Split into two layers:  
- grid_glyphs: Cell value representations (neutral or semantically meaningful)  
- op_glyphs: Operation abstractions (reusable across puzzles)  

. Example configuration:  
{  
  "grid_glyphs": ["🜀", "🜁", "🜂", "🜃", "🜄", "🜅", "🜆", "🜇", "🜈", "🜉"],  
  "op_glyphs": {  
    "tile_horizontal": "🜊",  
    "mirror_rows": "🜌",  
    "shift_down": "🜐",  
    "append_input": "🜒"  
  }  
}  

###Pipeline Overview  
1. Map Input to Glyphs  
Replace numbers with symbols based on puzzle type  
. Example: 0→ツ, 1→レ, 2→ハ, 3→ア  
Input:  
[[0, 1],  
 [2, 3]]  
Mapped:  
ツ レ  
ハ ア  

2. Prompt LLM for Meta-Operation  
Ask: "Study the transformation logic. Apply same rule to test input."  
Example response: "Swap rows"  

3. Map Response to Python Function  
Convert sigils to executable code (e.g., grid[::-1])  

4. Execute & Score  
Compare outputs; retry with new glyph sets if incorrect  

5. Track Stable Rules  
Store validated transformations with associated glyphs  

. Example Flow  
Input:  
モ オ  
コ ネ  
Mapped to Katakana:  
ツ レ  
ハ ア  
Output:  
ハ ア  
ツ レ  
LLM Response: Symbol("Swap rows")  
Interpreter: swap_rows() → correct output  

Test Input:  
✿ ★  
• ■  
Mapped Input:  
モ オ  
ネ コ  
LLM Response: "Apply same transformation"  
Predicted Output:  
ネ コ  
モ オ  
Execution: Function matches → score = 1.0  

## Why This Could Works  
- Avoids numeric/text bias through symbolic abstraction  
- Matches glyph sets to puzzle semantics (arrows→movement, runes→mirroring)  
- Leverages LLM pattern recognition instead of code generation  
- Executes via pre-verified functions  
- Refines through iterative glyph remapping  

## Future Steps for GridGlyph  
1. Export successful examples as training data  
2. Fine-tune small model (Mistral-like)  
3. Reduce prompt dependency through learned logic  
4. Build internal sigil execution engine  

## The Existing Framework
Here is the rewritten version, removing the comedy troupe analogy while preserving all functional descriptions in a clear, professional format:

# Multi-Agent System for ARC Puzzle Solving

## System Overview

A minimalist multi-agent architecture designed to solve ARC puzzles through coordinated specialization. The system comprises six distinct agents that work iteratively to analyze, hypothesize, implement, and validate solutions.

---

## Core Agent Roles

### 1. Orchestrator (Dispatcher)
**Function:** Workflow management  
**Responsibilities:**
- Coordinates agent execution order
- Maintains processing loop until solution is validated
- Terminates process upon successful validation
- Ensures proper state transitions between analysis and implementation phases

**Behavior Characteristics:**
- Strictly procedural
- No creative capabilities
- Maintains operational continuity

**Example Output:**  
"Initiating next iteration with Analyzer input"

---

### 2. Analyzer
**Function:** Pattern recognition and transformation analysis  
**Capabilities:**
- Identifies spatial relationships in input/output grids
- Detects positional transformations (e.g., mirroring, shifting)
- Recognizes value mappings between grid cells
- Tracks recurring structural patterns across examples

**Operational Traits:**
- Highly sensitive to subtle variations
- May generate complex interpretations of simple patterns
- Provides multiple potential transformation pathways

**Example Output:**  
"Detected horizontal reflection pattern with 92% confidence"

---

### 3. Synthesizer
**Function:** Program generation and implementation  
**Key Tasks:**
- Converts analytical findings into executable code
- Implements transformation logic using domain-specific language
- Applies identified patterns to test inputs
- Produces verifiable output predictions

**Execution Style:**
- Literal interpretation of specifications
- High fidelity to input instructions
- No autonomous modification of requirements

**Example Output:**  
"Generated function: apply_transformation(grid, mirror_horizontal=True)"

---

### 4. Checker
**Function:** Solution validation and feedback  
**Validation Process:**
- Compares predicted outputs against expected results
- Verifies consistency across all provided examples
- Identifies edge cases and special conditions
- Tracks success rates for different transformation types

**Feedback Mechanism:**
- Binary validation (success/failure)
- Specific error diagnostics
- Historical performance context

**Example Output:**  
"Validation failed: Mismatch at position (2,3) in third example"

---

## Operational Workflow

The system operates through iterative cycles:
1. **Analysis Phase:** Extract pattern characteristics from input/output pairs
2. **Synthesis Phase:** Generate candidate transformation programs
3. **Validation Phase:** Test implementations against all examples
4. **Iteration Decision:** Either refine approach or confirm solution

Each cycle continues until:
- A solution successfully transforms all examples
- Maximum iteration count is reached
- Confidence thresholds indicate unresolvable problem state

---

## Key Design Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Each agent maintains independent functionality
- **Iterative Refinement:** Allows progressive improvement of transformation logic
- **State Management:** Preserves historical attempts for learning purposes
- **Specialized Execution:** Separation of analysis, implementation, and validation tasks
- **Failure Tolerance:** Enables controlled retries with modified parameters

This structured approach enables systematic exploration of solution space while maintaining computational efficiency and verification rigor.

# Integration Strategy  
1. Embed GridGlyph's symbolic mapping into ARC Solver's input preprocessing  
2. Use LLM responses to generate symbolics programs for execution  
3. Leverage tracked stable rules as heuristics for puzzle clustering  
4. Feed execution results back to refine glyph mappings  
5. Combine explanation generators with symbolic reasoning traces


---

## The Training Process

### Goal:
Train a system to solve grid-based visual puzzles (like ARC) using **symbolic reasoning**, not raw pattern matching.

### Key Components:

1. **Glyphs**  
   - Symbolic representations of grid values (e.g., `0 → ✿`, `1 → ★`)
   - Used for abstraction and data augmentation
   - Different glyph sets are applied to the same puzzle to force generalization

2. **Sigils**  
   - Symbolic representations of operations (e.g., `🜌 = mirror horizontally`)
   - Form a small, structured grammar of allowed transformations
   - Sigil sequences represent full transformation rules (e.g., `🜌🜊 = mirror then tile`)

3. **Few-Shot Prompting**  
   - Use LLMs to generate training examples with input/output grids and corresponding sigil-based rules
   - These examples form a dataset of `(input_grid, output_grid, rule)` triples

4. **Model Training**  
   - Train a small model (e.g., fine-tuned Mistral, Phi-3, or CNN + transformer)
   - Input: grids (glyph-mapped)
   - Output: predicted sigil sequence (transformation rule)

5. **Validation & Iteration**  
   - Apply predicted sigil rule via a DSL (Domain-Specific Language)
   - Check if execution matches expected output
   - Track which glyph sets lead to correct predictions
   - Reinforce successful combinations; discard poor ones

6. **Generalization Testing**  
   - Test on unseen puzzles
   - Measure zero-shot performance
   - Evaluate rule consistency across different glyph sets

---

## Why This Avoids Overfitting & Encourages Generalization

### 1. **Structured Hypothesis Space**
- Only a limited set of valid sigil sequences are allowed
- Model can't memorize arbitrary solutions — must learn how to combine known operations

### 2. **Glyph Remapping as Data Augmentation**
- Same logic appears under different glyphs
- Forces model to recognize **patterns**, not symbols
- Prevents symbol anchoring and surface-level learning

### 3. **Compositional Rules**
- Even with few base operations, complex behaviors emerge from combinations
- Model learns to reuse and recombine logic instead of memorizing one-off patterns

### 4. **Zero-Shot Evaluation**
- Final test is on puzzles never seen during training
- Measures true generalization, not memorization

## Why Use Sigils Instead of Natural Language?

You could let the LLM just say "mirror horizontally", but that has major downsides:

| Aspect | Natural Language | Sigil-Based Rule |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Ambiguity | High – many ways to say same thing | Low – one symbol per operation |
| Compositionality | Poor – hard to combine descriptions | Strong – sigils can be sequenced |
| Learnability | Hard to map to functions | Direct mapping to DSL |
| Consistency | Varies per prompt/LLM | Fixed, predictable structure |
| Generalization | Easy to overfit to wording | Forces abstraction through structure |

### In short:
> **Natural language is expressive but ambiguous. Sigils are less expressive but more precise — and precision helps learning.**
