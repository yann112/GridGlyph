# ARC Solver â€” LangChain Agent Integration Plan

## Objective
Develop an AI agent using LangChain to coordinate program synthesis, execution, and analysis for solving ARC puzzles efficiently, with reasoning, validation, and explanation capabilities.

---

## Agent Design Philosophy
- Quickly build a working agent prototype integrating all key components.
- Use modular LangChain tools wrapping existing synthesis and analysis modules.
- Enable iterative reasoning with feedback loops to refine solutions.
- Support human-readable explanations for interpretability.
- Gradually enhance with smarter heuristics, memory, and multi-step workflows.

---

## Step 1: Agent Foundation Setup
- Initialize a LangChain agent connected to an LLM.
- Prepare a base prompt template including:
  - ARC puzzle description and input/output grid format.
  - DSL operation set and constraints.
  - Expected program output format.
- Deliverable: Agent that accepts puzzle inputs and produces initial program hypotheses.

---

## Step 2: Core Tool Wrappers
- Wrap key system components as LangChain tools with standard interfaces:
  - **ProgramSynthesizerTool:** Generates candidate transformation programs.
  - **ProgramExecutorTool:** Executes DSL programs on input grids.
  - **GridAnalyzerTool:** Computes difference masks and extracts puzzle features.
- Implement error handling and reporting in each tool.
- Deliverable: Agent can invoke synthesis, execution, and analysis through these tools.

---

## Step 3: Reasoning and Feedback Loop
- Design agent workflow:
  1. Analyze input/output grids to extract features.
  2. Generate candidate programs based on features.
  3. Execute programs and compare outputs.
  4. Diagnose mismatches, revise hypotheses, and retry.
- Support iterative improvement until success or timeout.
- Deliverable: Agent capable of end-to-end ARC puzzle solving with retries.

---

## Step 4: Heuristic and Few-Shot Guidance
- Implement dynamic selection of few-shot examples based on puzzle features.
- Incorporate heuristics to:
  - Prioritize transformations likely to solve the puzzle.
  - Reduce search space by focusing on relevant grid regions.
- Deliverable: Improved efficiency and accuracy of agent-generated solutions.

---

## Step 5: Explanation Generation
- Develop natural language explanation generators to:
  - Summarize the transformation program steps.
  - Highlight input-output differences visually and textually.
  - Provide debugging hints if solution fails.
- Deliverable: Human-readable solution reports to aid understanding and debugging.

---

## Step 6: Integration Testing and Evaluation
- Benchmark agent-enhanced solver against baseline pure synthesis:
  - Measure accuracy on a representative ARC puzzle set.
  - Track runtime and resource consumption.
  - Evaluate solution complexity and agent reasoning quality.
- Identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement.
- Deliverable: Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the agent approach.

---

## Optional Advanced Enhancements
- Implement puzzle clustering and transfer learning between similar puzzles.
- Develop multi-agent collaboration frameworks (e.g., separate synthesis, analysis, and explanation agents).
- Integrate spatial reasoning visual chains-of-thought.
- Build iterative refinement loops with memory of past attempts.
- Detect unsolvable or out-of-scope puzzles early.
