# ARC Solver — LangChain Agent Integration Plan

## Objective
Develop an AI agent using LangChain that collaborates with the existing program synthesis system to solve ARC puzzles through guided program generation, validation, and explanation.

---

## Generic Plan: Agent-Centric Approach

### 1. Design Agent Architecture
- Define the agent's role and responsibilities (e.g., program proposer, validator, explainer)
- Decide on reasoning style: single-step vs. multi-step iterative reasoning
- Determine memory needs: short-term context vs. puzzle-specific state retention

### 2. Build Tool Integration Layer
- Wrap existing synthesis components as LangChain tools:
  - Program generation
  - Program execution (DSL interpreter)
  - Grid analysis and difference computation
- Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms within tools

### 3. Develop Reasoning Capabilities
- Design prompt templates for:
  - Program proposal and hypothesis generation
  - Failure analysis and error diagnostics
  - Solution explanation and summarization
- Incorporate few-shot learning examples to guide the agent’s reasoning

### 4. Create Evaluation Framework
- Define metrics for agent performance:
  - Accuracy of program suggestions
  - Efficiency in search space reduction
  - Quality and clarity of explanations

# Step-by-Step Agent Development

## Step 1: Agent Foundation Setup
- Initialize a LangChain agent with LLM connectivity
- Develop a base prompt template including:
  - ARC task description and input/output formats
  - Available DSL operations and constraints
  - Expected output program structure
- **Deliverable:** A minimal agent capable of accepting ARC input/output pairs and producing initial outputs

---

## Step 2: Core Tool Implementation
- Wrap key components as LangChain tools:
  - `ProgramSynthesizerTool` — wraps your synthesis engine
  - `ProgramExecutorTool` — runs generated programs on grids
  - `GridAnalyzerTool` — performs grid difference and feature extraction
- Implement validation, error reporting, and graceful degradation in tools
- **Deliverable:** Agent can invoke synthesis and execution operations via tools

---

## Step 3: Agent Reasoning Loop
- Implement the main reasoning workflow:
  1. Analyze input/output grids and extract features
  2. Generate synthesis hypotheses based on features
  3. Execute candidate programs and compare results
  4. Reflect and revise hypotheses on failure
- Enable iterative improvements and retries
- **Deliverable:** Agent capable of end-to-end problem-solving attempts with feedback loops

---

## Step 4: Performance Optimization
- Add dynamic few-shot example selection tailored to problem features
- Guide program search using heuristics derived from feature analysis:
  - Likely transformation patterns
  - Expected repetition counts
  - Detected symmetry or component patterns
- Prioritize shorter or higher-confidence programs
- **Deliverable:** Agent exhibits improved efficiency and reduced search complexity

---

## Step 5: Explanation Generation
- Build natural language explanation generators that:
  - Describe the solution program in human-readable terms
  - Highlight differences between input and output visually and textually
  - Step through transformations applied
- Support debugging and interpretability
- **Deliverable:** Clear, human-interpretable solution reports for each puzzle

---

## Step 6: Integration Testing
- Benchmark the LangChain agent-enhanced system against baseline pure synthesis approach:
  - Compare success rates on diverse ARC puzzles
  - Measure speed and resource consumption
  - Analyze solution complexity and robustness
- Identify complementary strengths and failure modes
- **Deliverable:** Quantitative and qualitative validation of hybrid approach benefits
