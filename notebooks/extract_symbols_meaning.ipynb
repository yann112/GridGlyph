Here's the breakdown:\\n\\n1. **♙ (Pawn)**: Represents a small, static piece in chess. It does not suggest movement or transformation but rather a fixed position on the board.\\n2. **♖ (Rook)**: Represents a piece that moves in straight lines (horizontally or vertically). While it implies movement, its primary role is as a static component in the structure of the game.\\n3. **♘ (Knight)**: Represents a piece that moves in an L-shape. It suggests movement but is also a static component on the board.\\n4. **♗ (Bishop)**: Represents a piece that moves diagonally. It suggests movement but is also a static component on the board.\\n5. **♕ (Queen)**: Represents a powerful piece that can move in any direction (like a rook and bishop combined). It suggests movement but is also a static component on the board.\\n6. **♔ (King)**: Represents the most important piece, which moves one square in any direction. It suggests movement but is also a static component on the board.\\n7. **♟ (Pawn)**: Same as ♙, representing a small, static piece.\\n8. **♜ (Rook)**: Same as ♖, representing a piece that moves in straight lines.\\n9. **♞ (Knight)**: Same as ♘, representing a piece that moves in an L-shape.\\n10. **♝ (Bishop)**: Same as ♗, representing a piece that moves diagonally.\\n\\n### Analysis:\\n- **Gridglyph**: These symbols are primarily static elements designed to fit into a grid (the chessboard). They represent fixed positions and roles within the game.\\n- **Sigil**: While these symbols imply movement (e.g., the way a rook moves horizontally or a knight moves in an L-shape), their primary function is as static components on the board. The movement they suggest is more about their gameplay mechanics rather than visual transformation.\\n\\n### Categorization:\\nGiven that these symbols are primarily static elements with defined roles on a grid, but also imply movement as part of their function, we can assign the following scores:\\n\\n- **Gridglyph**: 60% (static elements on a grid)\\n- **Sigil**: 40% (suggest movement or transformation in gameplay)\\n\\n### Final Response:\\n```\\nsymbolset: gridglyph: 60%, sigil: 40%\\n```\"\n",

Here's the breakdown:\\n\\n1. **♙ (Pawn)**: Represents a small, static piece in chess. It does not suggest movement or transformation but rather a fixed position on the board.\\n2. **♖ (Rook)**: Represents a piece that moves in straight lines (horizontally or vertically). While it implies movement, its primary role is as a static component in the structure of the game.\\n3. **♘ (Knight)**: Represents a piece that moves in an L-shape. It suggests movement but is also a static component on the board.\\n4. **♗ (Bishop)**: Represents a piece that moves diagonally. It suggests movement but is also a static component on the board.\\n5. **♕ (Queen)**: Represents a powerful piece that can move in any direction (like a rook and bishop combined). It suggests movement but is also a static component on the board.\\n6. **♔ (King)**: Represents the most important piece, which moves one square in any direction. It suggests movement but is also a static component on the board.\\n7. **♟ (Pawn)**: Same as ♙, representing a small, static piece.\\n8. **♜ (Rook)**: Same as ♖, representing a piece that moves in straight lines.\\n9. **♞ (Knight)**: Same as ♘, representing a piece that moves in an L-shape.\\n10. **♝ (Bishop)**: Same as ♗, representing a piece that moves diagonally.\\n\\n### Analysis:\\n- **Gridglyph**: These symbols are primarily static elements designed to fit into a grid (the chessboard). They represent fixed positions and roles within the game.\\n- **Sigil**: While these symbols imply movement (e.g., the way a rook moves horizontally or a knight moves in an L-shape), their primary function is as static components on the board. The movement they suggest is more about their gameplay mechanics rather than visual transformation.\\n\\n### Categorization:\\nGiven that these symbols are primarily static elements with defined roles on a grid, but also imply movement as part of their function, we can assign the following scores:\\n\\n- **Gridglyph**: 60% (static elements on a grid)\\n- **Sigil**: 40% (suggest movement or transformation in gameplay)\\n\\n### Final Response:\\n```\\nsymbolset: gridglyph: 60%, sigil: 40%\\n```\"\n",

      "```\n",

      "1. **First Row Remains Unchanged**: The first row of the input grid (`['イ', 'ロ', 'ハ', 'ニ', 'ホ']`) is identical in the output grid.\n",
      "2. **Subsequent Rows Are Shifted**: Each subsequent row in the output grid is a **cyclic shift** of the corresponding row in the input grid.\n",
