# Quick-Start Two-Agent LangChain System Roadmap (Flexible Iterative Loop)

## Step 1: Define Clear Agent Roles & Interfaces

### Analyze Agent
- **Input:** ARC input/output grids (and optionally synthesis feedback)
- **Tasks:**
  - Extract key features and patterns (colors, shapes, symmetries, transformations)
  - Summarize transformation hypotheses and clues
  - Optionally refine or deepen analysis based on synthesis outcomes or failure cases
- **Output:** Structured analysis report / feature summary for Synthesize Agent and Orchestrator Agent

### Synthesize Agent
- **Input:** Analysis report + ARC input/output grids (and optionally previous synthesis feedback)
- **Tasks:**
  - Propose candidate DSL programs informed by analysis
  - Execute candidate programs via ProgramExecutorTool
  - Validate outputs, compare with target output
  - Provide success/failure feedback to orchestrator
  - Request further analysis or retry synthesis as needed
- **Output:** Candidate program(s) or retry instructions

## Step 2: Wrap Existing Components as LangChain Tools

- **GridAnalyzerTool:** Wrap your feature extractor and grid difference analyzer
- **ProgramSynthesizerTool:** Wrap your program synthesis engine
- **ProgramExecutorTool:** Wrap your DSL interpreter to run candidate programs
- **(Optional) GridDiffTool:** To compare program execution output vs target output

> Each tool should have clear input/output interfaces, handle errors gracefully, and provide informative logging.

## Step 3: Build a LangChain Multi-Tool Agent (Orchestrator)

- Initialize a LangChain agent with access to all above tools
- Design prompt templates describing:
  - The roles and capabilities of each tool
  - The iterative reasoning loop: analyze → synthesize → execute → evaluate → reflect → retry
  - Instructions for when to request further analysis or refine synthesis
- Enable the agent to:
  - Use tools conditionally and repeatedly in one session
  - Maintain short-term memory or scratchpad to keep context of past results and failures
- Example workflow:
  1. Call `GridAnalyzerTool` for initial feature extraction
  2. Call `ProgramSynthesizerTool` to propose programs based on analysis
  3. Call `ProgramExecutorTool` to test candidate programs
  4. If failure, call `GridAnalyzerTool` with more specific queries or context, then retry synthesis

## Step 4: Design Adaptive Prompting & Reasoning

- Provide few-shot examples showing the iterative analyze-synthesize loop
- Include tool usage instructions and expected outputs
- Emphasize the need for explanation, retrying, and refining solutions
- Use ReAct or function-calling style agents to dynamically select tools and actions

## Step 5: Implement Memory & Caching (Optional but Recommended)

- Use LangChain’s memory modules (e.g., `ConversationBufferMemory`)
- Cache analysis results and synthesis attempts to avoid redundant work
- Store feedback loops and failures to guide agent reasoning

## Step 6: Integration Testing & Iteration

- Test the full multi-tool agent on ARC puzzles
- Monitor success rates, retries, and reasoning efficiency
- Log failure modes to improve tool implementations or prompt design
- Iterate by adding:
  - More granular analysis tools
  - Heuristic-guided synthesis pruning
  - Natural language explanation generation

## Additional Considerations

- **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling and logging at each step to facilitate debugging and iteration.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for each component and the overall system architecture.
- **Scalability:** Consider how the system can be scaled to handle more complex puzzles and larger datasets.
