# ARC Solver â€” Unified Development Roadmap

## Philosophy

Our approach prioritizes building a **minimal viable end-to-end system** as quickly as possible, integrating the essential components:  
- Program synthesis  
- Grid and feature analysis  
- Agent reasoning and orchestration  

This working baseline enables practical testing on real ARC puzzles early. Once stable, each module will be incrementally improved based on observed needs and failure cases.

## Step 1: Build a Minimal Working System Integrating Synthesis, Analysis, and Agent Orchestration

- Combine existing program synthesis engine, feature analysis modules, and a simple LangChain agent into a single pipeline.
- The pipeline should be able to:
  - Accept ARC input/output grid pairs
  - Extract features and analyze grids
  - Generate candidate transformation programs with synthesis
  - Execute and validate these programs on input grids
  - Produce basic explanation or success/failure feedback
- Components should be simple and modular to facilitate easy iteration.
- **Deliverable:** A functional, end-to-end ARC puzzle solver prototype.

## Step 2: Modular Enhancements and Refinements

- Improve individual modules incrementally:
  - Expand DSL expressivity and interpreter robustness
  - Enhance feature extraction and heuristic pruning methods
  - Refine agent reasoning with iterative feedback loops and state retention
  - Develop program ranking, scoring, and selection mechanisms
- Regularly measure improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

---

## Step 3: Advanced Agent Capabilities and Learning

- Integrate few-shot prompting or meta-learning to guide program synthesis.
- Develop multi-agent collaboration frameworks, e.g., synthesis agent + analysis agent.
- Implement natural language explanation generation for interpretability.
- Explore clustering and transfer learning to leverage similarities across puzzles.

---

## Step 4: Optimization and Scaling

- Optimize search algorithms and pruning strategies to handle more complex puzzles.
- Improve computational efficiency and memory management.
- Introduce caching and incremental computation where possible.
- Benchmark performance on diverse ARC puzzle datasets.

---

## Step 5: Extension and Maintenance

- Extend DSL with additional transformation primitives as needed.
- Add new feature extractors or pattern detectors to improve puzzle understanding.
- Maintain modular architecture for easy testing and updates.
- Document design decisions, known limitations, and usage guidelines.
