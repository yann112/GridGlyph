# 🧠 ARC Solver — Unified Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Goal

Build a flexible, modular system for solving ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) puzzles using:
- Program synthesis
- Grid pattern analysis
- LLM-based reasoning
- Orchestrated strategy switching

---

## 🧱 Core Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ✅ Minimal Viable System First | Build a working end-to-end pipeline early |
| 🔁 Modular Architecture | Keep components decoupled for easy iteration |
| 🔄 Strategy Rotation | Try different solving approaches iteratively |
| 🧩 Hybrid Solutions | Combine successful partial solutions |
| 📈 Extensible by Design | Add new tools and strategies without breaking existing logic |

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 🥇 Step 1: Build a Minimal Working System

**Goal:** Create an end-to-end solver prototype that runs on real puzzles.

#### Tasks:
- Integrate existing modules: `SynthesisEngine`, `GridAnalyzerTool`, `ProgramSynthesizerTool`
- Implement orchestrator loop with basic strategy rotation
- Use `OpenRouterClient` or similar LLM client for reasoning
- Support both DSL node generation and simple function-based transformations

#### Deliverable:
- ✅ A working system that can solve simple puzzles
- ✅ Structured output including solution, confidence, insights, and failed attempts
- ✅ Test suite integration (`pytest`) to verify baseline behavior

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Modular Enhancements and Refinements

**Goal:** Improve each component independently based on test results and failure cases.

#### Components to Improve:
- 🔁 **Synthesis Engine**
  - Support pixel-level transformation functions
  - Handle shape-changing transformations
  - Score based on symbolic + empirical matching
- 🔍 **Grid Analyzer Tool**
  - Extract more detailed insights (e.g., alternating patterns)
  - Detect flipping, object movement, color mapping
- 🤖 **LLM Prompt Engineering**
  - Write better prompts for analysis and program suggestions
  - Include context from past iterations
- 📊 **Confidence Scoring**
  - Move beyond cell match ratio
  - Use symbolic logic (Z3), structure similarity, etc.
- 🧪 **Test Coverage**
  - Add tests for hybrid transformations
  - Log edge cases and failures systematically

#### Deliverables:
- ✅ Enhanced synthesis engine with pixel-level support
- ✅ Better feature extraction and pattern detection
- ✅ More accurate confidence scoring
- ✅ Improved prompt templates
- ✅ Expanded test coverage

### 🧠 Step 3: Advanced Agent Capabilities and Learning

**Goal:** Make the system smarter over time using iterative feedback and learning.

#### Tasks:
- 🤝 Multi-Agent Collaboration
  - Run multiple agents in parallel or sequence
  - Synthesize insights across them
- 💡 Feedback Loop
  - Use failed attempts to refine future strategies
- 🧠 Meta-Learning
  - Learn which strategies work best for certain puzzle types
- 📜 Natural Language Explanations
  - Generate human-readable explanations of transformations
- 🧬 Transfer Learning
  - Reuse patterns across similar puzzles

#### Deliverables:
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration system
- ✅ Strategy memory and adaptation
- ✅ Interpretability via natural language
- ✅ Puzzle clustering and transfer mechanisms

### ⚙️ Step 4: Optimization and Scaling

**Goal:** Make the system fast, efficient, and robust.

#### Tasks:
- 🔍 Search Space Optimization
  - Prune impossible programs early
  - Prioritize promising strategies
- ⏱️ Performance Improvements
  - Optimize execution speed
  - Reduce redundant computations
- 💾 Memory Management
  - Cache grid transformations
  - Avoid recomputation where possible
- 📈 Benchmarking
  - Measure accuracy, speed, and success rate
  - Track progress over time

#### Deliverables:
- ✅ Optimized search algorithms
- ✅ Faster execution engine
- ✅ Scalable architecture for complex puzzles
- ✅ Benchmark reports and performance metrics

---

### 🌱 Step 5: Extension and Maintenance

**Goal:** Keep the system evolving and maintainable.

#### Tasks:
- 🧩 Extend DSL
  - Add new primitives like `Alternate(...)`, `Sequence(...)`
- 🔍 Add New Analyzers
  - Object-level reasoning
  - Spatial relationship detectors
- 🧪 Maintainability
  - Keep code clean and well-documented
  - Support plug-and-play modules
- 📚 Documentation
  - Clear module descriptions
  - Usage examples and API docs

#### Deliverables:
- ✅ Flexible, extensible DSL
