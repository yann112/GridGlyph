# ARC Prize 2025 — Approach Summary

## Goal
Build an AI system to solve ARC-AGI-2 visual reasoning puzzles by identifying and applying transformation rules between input and output grids.

---

## Key Ideas

### 1. Grid Processing
- Represent puzzles as 2D grids with cells.
- Convert colors to numeric IDs.
- Normalize input/output grid sizes.

### 2. Change Detection
- Compare input and output grids to identify changed vs unchanged cells.
- Generate difference masks to isolate transformation zones.

### 3. Pattern Matching & Displacement
- Use pattern detection to identify shapes or objects in grids.
- Match patterns between input and output.
- Compute transformations like translation, rotation, color changes.
- Generalize these transformations into reusable rules.

### 4. Hybrid Reasoning System: LLM + Python Tools
- Use an LLM (e.g., GPT) to interpret input/output examples and hypothesize transformation rules.
- Use Python tools (e.g., OpenCV, NumPy) for:
  - Grid manipulation
  - Pattern detection
  - Applying and testing candidate rules
- Orchestrate reasoning and coding iteratively using **LangChain** or similar frameworks.

## Why OpenCV + LangChain + LLM?

| Component    | Role                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| OpenCV       | Fast, robust grid/pattern detection and transforms |
| LLM          | Abstract reasoning, rule hypothesis generation  |
| LangChain    | Coordination of LLM reasoning and Python code execution |

---

## Proposed Workflow

1. **Preprocess inputs:** Use OpenCV to segment grids into objects/patterns.
2. **Feature extraction:** Extract size, shape, color, position features.
3. **Hypothesis generation:** Feed features and examples to LLM to suggest transformation rules.
4. **Code generation:** LLM generates Python code implementing transformations.
5. **Execution & testing:** Run code on inputs, compare results to expected outputs.
6. **Iterate:** Refine rules and code until solution generalizes.

## Next Steps

- Design modular Python API for grid and pattern operations.
- Integrate Python tools as LangChain tools or Python REPL.
- Prototype example LLM prompts to generate transformation code.
- Test approach on simple ARC tasks and build complexity gradually.
