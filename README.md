# ARC Solver — Focused General Plan

## Objective
Build a minimal viable AI system to solve a limited subset of ARC puzzles by discovering and applying simple transformation rules between input and output grids.

---

## Scope & Priorities

- Start with **simpler puzzles**: fixed grid sizes or small variations, limited color palette, straightforward transformations (e.g., translation, recoloring).
- Postpone advanced cognitive features (reinforcement learning, meta-cognition, hierarchical reasoning) until baseline is stable.
- Prioritize **robust preprocessing** and **clear difference detection** as foundation.
- Gradually increase complexity and puzzle variety based on solid, tested components.

---

## Core Components (Minimal Baseline)

### 1. Grid Representation & Preprocessing
- Convert grids into 2D NumPy arrays.
- Normalize sizes and align input/output grids for easy comparison.

### 2. Difference Mask & Change Detection
- Identify changed cells with a difference mask.
- Focus on areas of change to reduce search space for transformations.

### 3. Simple Pattern Detection
- Detect connected components or shapes using OpenCV.
- Extract simple features: size, color, position.

### 4. Basic Transformation Application
- Implement basic, manual transformations (e.g., translate shape by (dx, dy), recolor cells).
- Apply transformations and compare results to expected outputs.

---

## Tools & Framework

- **Python** with NumPy and OpenCV for grid and shape operations.
- Optional: Basic LLM interaction for code snippet generation, but **not required initially**.
- Build a modular codebase to allow gradual integration of advanced reasoning later.

---

## Future Enhancements (To Be Added After Baseline)

- Mental simulation sandbox for rule testing.
- Reinforcement learning to optimize transformation search.
- Hierarchical reasoning and episodic memory.
- Meta-cognition and self-assessment modules.

---

## Summary

Focus first on creating a **working prototype** that handles simple ARC puzzles end-to-end. Only after this baseline is reliable, layer on more sophisticated AI components.

# ARC Solver — Step-by-Step Action Plan (Minimal Viable Baseline)

## Step 1: Grid Representation and Difference Mask

- Implement functions to:
  - Load or define input/output ARC grids as 2D NumPy arrays.
  - Normalize grid sizes.
  - Compute a difference mask highlighting changed cells.

- Deliverable: Working code that outputs difference masks for sample puzzles.

---

## Step 2: Simple Pattern Detection on Input Grid

- Use OpenCV or connected components to:
  - Identify shapes or colored regions.
  - Extract simple features (position, size, color).

- Deliverable: List of detected objects with their attributes.

---

## Step 3: Implement Manual Transformation Functions

- Code basic transformations:
  - Translation of detected shapes.
  - Simple recoloring of cells.

- Deliverable: Functions that apply transformations to input grids.

---

## Step 4: Test Transformations Against Output

- For a given puzzle:
  - Apply manual transformations to input shapes.
  - Compare results with output grids.
  - Calculate success metrics (e.g., exact match or similarity score).

- Deliverable: Script that can verify if a manual transformation solves the puzzle.

---

## Step 5 (Optional): Simple LLM-Assisted Code Generation

- Experiment with prompting an LLM to:
  - Generate transformation code snippets given grid descriptions.
  - Use outputs to augment manual transformations.

- Deliverable: Prototype integrating LLM suggestions for transformations.

---

## General Recommendations

- Write unit tests and automated validation for each step.
- Start with a small, well-understood ARC subset.
- Avoid premature optimization or adding complexity.
- Document assumptions and failures for continuous learning.
