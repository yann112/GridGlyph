# 🧠 ARC Solver Roadmap (Memo)

### 🎯 **Goal**
Train a **tiny, efficient model** (e.g. TinyLlama) to predict **valid DSL rules** from input grids — and use it to solve ARC puzzles.

You're not brute-forcing. You're not using GPT-4.  
You're building a **symbolic reasoning engine** with **grounded semantics**.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Finalize Rule Generation  
**→ Reach 1000 high-quality, diverse DSL rules**

- Keep running your LLM loop.
- Cycle through complexity prompts:
  - `simple`: atomic rules (`⇒`, `⌖`, `▦`)
  - `moderate`: 2–3 level nesting
  - `complex`: logical chains (`⟹`, `∨`, `ⓑ`)
  - `advanced`: recursive patterns (like `00dbd492`)
- Use `mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct`
- Set `rules_per_batch = 5`, `temperature = 0.7`
- Stop when: **1000 valid rules collected**

> ✅ This is your **training corpus**.

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Build (Grid, Rule) Training Dataset  
**→ Create synthetic pairs for model training**

For each rule:
1. Extract the pattern from `▦(...)` using regex.
2. Generate a **minimal input grid** that contains the pattern.
3. Add light noise (optional) to make it realistic.
4. Pair: `{ "input_grid": [[...]], "dsl_rule": "⌖(⌂, ▦(...))" }`

Do this **programmatically** — no neural model needed.

> ✅ This is your **training data**.

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Train a Tiny Model  
**→ Teach a small model to predict rules from grids**

- Use **TinyLlama-1.1B** or **Phi-2**
- Fine-tune with **LoRA** (efficient)
- Input: `input_grid` as text
- Output: `dsl_rule` as text
- Train on your (grid, rule) dataset

> ✅ This is your **rule proposer**.

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Build the ARC Solver  
**→ Use the model to solve puzzles**

For each ARC test puzzle:
1. Run the trained model on the **input grid** → get top 5 rule predictions.
2. **Execute** each rule on the input.
3. **Check** if output matches expected.
4. If yes → **submit**.
5. If no → **mutate** (e.g., change colors, nesting) and retry.

> ✅ This is your **solver loop**.

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Scale to Complex Puzzles  
**→ Go beyond atomic rules**

- Add **rule composition**: combine atomic rules into sequences (`⧎`, `⟹`)
- Add **search with feedback**: use intermediate outputs to guide next steps
- Add **meta-reasoning**: classify puzzle type (symmetry, counting, etc.) to guide strategy

> ✅ This is your **reasoning engine**.

---

## ✅ Your Edge vs. Big Teams

| You | Big Teams |
|-----|----------|
| Small, focused model | Massive LLMs (wasteful) |
| Grounded in real semantics | Black-box guessing |
| Programmatic data synthesis | Brute-force or web-scale data |
| Full control | Over-engineered, slow |

You’re not competing on scale.  
You’re competing on **intelligence, precision, and efficiency**.

## ✅ Final Note

You don’t need:
- ❌ A model that generates grids from rules
- ❌ 10M training examples
- ❌ GPT-4 or 100 GPUs

You need:
- ✅ 1000 good rules
- ✅ 1000 meaningful (grid, rule) pairs
- ✅ One small, well-trained model
- ✅ A smart solver loop
