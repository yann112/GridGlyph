# Simple Project Plan for GridGlyph ARC Challenge

Here’s a part-time, solo-friendly plan to prepare a clean GridGlyph model and dataset by year’s end (‘end of ARC competition’). This roadmap balances steady progress with minimal overhead, keeping your project focused so you can finish alongside your regular job.

## 1. Project Milestones & Timeline

| Phase                | Tasks                                    | Target Timeframe     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **I. Dataset Finalization**     | - Curate atomic & combinator rule examples- Run validation tests each batch- Format for training (tokenizer-ready) | Aug–Sept         |
| **II. Model Setup**            | - Integrate Qwen 0.5B with LoRA/adapters- Extend tokenizer with DSL- Prepare training scripts | Sept (1–2 weeks) |
| **III. Initial Fine-Tuning**   | - Train on synthetic/validated data- Save checkpoints- Monitor for issues | Late Sept–Oct    |
| **IV. Evaluation & Iteration** | - Score model on ARC benchmark- Analyze errors- Augment or clean dataset | Oct–Nov          |
| **V. Final Fine-Tuning**       | - Retrain on augmented/final data- Tune based on evaluation feedback | Nov              |
| **VI. Documentation & Clean-Up**| - Write up code/docs/readme- Package datasets- Back up everything | Dec (1st half)   |
| **VII. Submission/Wrap-Up**    | - Submit to ARC comp (if desired)- Publicly release/clean repo | Dec (before deadline) |

## 2. Weekly Action Template

- **3–5 hours/week:** Prioritize progress over perfection
- Pick 1–2 “focus tasks” per week—example:
  - Validate 1,000 rules
  - Run unit tests
  - Tweak/extend trainer config
  - Run short fine-tune (overnight on Kaggle)
  - Score results/evaluate and log findings
- End each session with a short note: what worked, what’s next

## 3. Core Project Principles

- **Keep it small and interpretable:** Only add/test rules and commands you can validate and understand.
- **Reuse and adapt code/examples:** Use open frameworks (Hugging Face, PEFT) and official LoRA/Adapter scripts to speed up model work.
- **Save regularly:** Kaggle can time out; checkpoint your model/data frequently.
- **Prioritize clean validation:** Data quality > pure quantity for both rules and training runs.
- **Limit scope:** You do not need “fancy” pipelines or cutting-edge model tricks—just make the current pipeline work well and keep your code tidy.

## 4. Minimal Checklist for Success

- [ ] 60,000+ atomic rules validated/formatted
- [ ] 20,000 combinator rules added/checked
- [ ] Qwen 0.5B integrated, with LoRA/Adapter ready
- [ ] Tokenizer covers all DSL/symbol tokens
- [ ] Training script runs and can checkpoint/resume
- [ ] Achieve >10–20% ARC score (or best effort on your time!)
- [ ] Evaluation pipeline outputs clean, reproducible scores/logs
- [ ] ReadMe and documentation for usage/reproducibility
- [ ] Code, data, and results safely backed up

## 5. Project Success Tips

- Schedule weekly check-ins with yourself (short TODOs, clear “done” criteria).
- If stuck, pare down tasks instead of adding new ones.
- Take credit for what you finish—keep your repo, data, and notes organized.
- Prepare for final code/data packaging in December, so you’re not rushed before the deadline.

**By following this streamlined plan and focusing on core deliverables, you’ll have a “clean project” and competitive ARC submission, with manageable, step-by-step progress that fits your part-time schedule.**
