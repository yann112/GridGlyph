# GridGlyph

## A Symbolic Reasoning Engine for Solving Visual Logic Puzzles

GridGlyph is a hybrid symbolic-AI + LLM system designed to solve grid-based visual reasoning puzzles (like those found in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus - ARC) by transforming numeric grids into abstract symbolic representations and prompting large language models to generate executable transformation logic.

The system uses:
- glyphs: Symbol sets that map numbers to abstract characters (using Katakana for best rendering)
- sigil: Transformation instructions encoded as Python functions or logical cues

This README explains how everything fits together.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### 1. GridGlyph (Project Name)

> The full pipeline that solves visual pattern puzzles using symbolic abstraction.

GridGlyph teaches AI to see transformations visually:
- Not by number values
- But by structure, repetition, mirroring, rotation, etc.
- Using symbolic prompts → getting code from LLMs → executing it → scoring results

---

### 2. glyph (Symbol Mapping Set)

> A symbolic character set used to represent numeric grids visually.

Each `glyph` maps numbers 0–9 to abstract symbols — but we now default to **Katakana** for better rendering compatibility.

Example:
{
  "id": "katakana",
  "symbols": ["ツ", "レ", "ハ", "ア", "ヤ", "ユ", "ヨ", "キ", "ク", "ケ"]
}

Mapped Input:
[[0, 1], [2, 3]] → [["ツ", "レ"], ["ハ", "ア"]]

Why this matters:
- Avoids broken or missing symbols
- Forces pattern recognition
- Makes prompts more readable
- Works in most terminals and chat UIs

---

### 3. sigil (Transformation Glyph)

> The transformation rule expressed as executable logic.

A `sigil` can be:
- A natural language description of the transformation
- Or a Python function generated by the LLM based on few-shot prompts

Example:
def transform(grid):
    row1 = grid[0] * 3
    row2 = grid[1] * 3
    return [
        row1,
        row2,
        row1[::-1],
        row2[::-1]
    ]

Why this works:
- Encodes logic in structured form
- Makes execution easy
- Can evolve into a formal transformation grammar

## 🔁 Pipeline Overview

1. Input Puzzle
   - Numeric input/output grid pairs
   - May include test input only

2. Map to glyph
   - Choose a glyph set (e.g., katakana, emoji, box drawing)
   - Convert all numbers to symbolic characters

3. Build Few-Shot Prompt
   - Show multiple symbolic versions of the same puzzle
   - Ask LLM to return a Python function called `transform()`

4. Extract sigil function
   - Parse the returned Python function from LLM response

5. Execute & Score
   - Run the function locally
   - Compare predicted output vs expected result

6. Output Result
   - Return function, mapped grids, score, and glyphset used

## 🧠 Why This Works Even Better with Katakana

By choosing Katakana as your default glyph set:

| Benefit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ High Rendering Compatibility | Renders correctly in almost all terminals |
| ✅ Strong Shape Contrast | Each symbol looks distinct |
| ✅ Monospaced Alignment | Keeps grid structure intact |
| ✅ No Linguistic Bias | Not tied to meaning or order |
| ✅ Good for Pattern Recognition | Structured, not distracting |

This ensures:
- Your prompts are clean and consistent
- You avoid tokenization issues
- You maximize inference quality from LLMs

## 📦 Example Flow Using Katakana Glyphs

Input Puzzle:
[[0, 1],
 [2, 3]]

Mapped to 'katakana' glyph:
[['ツ', 'レ'],
 ['ハ', 'ア']]

LLM prompt asks:
"Study this transformation and return a Python function called `transform()`"

LLM returns:
def transform(grid):
    row1 = grid[0] * 3
    row2 = grid[1] * 3
    return [
        row1,
        row2,
        row1[::-1],
        row2[::-1]
    ]

You execute it → compare output → score it

}

## 🚀 Why This Works So Well

Using Katakana as your core `glyph` representation gives you:
- ✅ Clean visual separation
- ✅ Excellent readability
- ✅ Tokenization safety
- ✅ Strong pattern detection

And `sigil` logic keeps it grounded in code:
- Easy to test
- Easy to integrate into synthesis tools
- Ready for feedback loops later
