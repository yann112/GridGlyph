# ARC Puzzle Solver - Agentic System  
*Minimalist multi-agent system for ARC puzzles*  

## Core Agents  

### **Orchestrator** (Brain)  
- Manages workflow  
- Selects strategies  
- Evaluates solutions  
- Decides when to stop  

### **Analyzer** (Detective)  
- Finds patterns in grids  
- Identifies differences  
- Suggests transformations  

### **Synthesizer** (Worker)  
- Generates programs based on analysis
- evaluate programs


## Workflow  
1. Analyzer examines input/output  
2. Orchestrator picks strategy  
3. Synthesizer builds solution  
4. Process repeats until solved
