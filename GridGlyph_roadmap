# GridGlyph - Symbolic Puzzle Reasoning Engine

## Vision

GridGlyph is a symbolic reasoning system that solves visual grid transformation puzzles by:  
- Mapping numeric grids to abstract symbol sets  
- Prompting LLMs to infer transformation logic  
- Synthesizing and testing code  
- Iterating until solution is found  

This mimics how humans solve ARC puzzles — by seeing patterns, not pixels or numbers.

## Phase 1: Symbolic Abstraction Layer

### Step 1: Build Symbol Dictionary (symbols.json)  
- Define multiple symbolic sets:  
  - Runic  
  - Katakana  
  - Arrows  
  - Box Drawing  
  - Egyptian Hieroglyphs  
  - Math Symbols  
  - Emoji  
  - Dice Dots  
  - Braille  
  - Cypriot Syllabary  

Each set includes:  
- Description  
- List of 10 symbols for \[0..9\]  
- Recommended use case (e.g., mirroring, movement, classification)

### Step 2: Create Symbol Mapping Engine  
- Function: `map_grid_to_symbols(grid, symbol_set)`  
- Function: `detect_background_and_objects(grid)`  
- Function: `suggest_best_symbol_set(puzzle_type)`  

### Step 3: Add Symbol Set Diversity  
- For each puzzle → try 2–3 different symbol sets  
- Helps LLM generalize better  
- Avoids numeric bias

## Phase 2: Enhanced Analyzer Tool

### Step 4: Build Symbolic Grid Prompt Generator  
- Input: list of input/output grid pairs  
- Output: few-shot prompt with mapped symbolic grids  

Example:

Input:  
\[\[7, 9\], \[4, 3\]\]  

Mapped with runic:  
ᚠ ᛉ  
ᛟ ᛃ  

Output:  
ᚠ ᛉ ᚠ ᛉ ᚠ ᛉ  
ᛟ ᛃ ᛟ ᛃ ᛟ ᛃ  
ᛉ ᚠ ᛉ ᚠ ᛉ ᚠ  
ᛃ ᛟ ᛃ ᛟ ᛃ ᛟ  
ᚠ ᛉ ᚠ ᛉ ᚠ ᛉ  
ᛟ ᛃ ᛟ ᛃ ᛟ ᛃ  

Prompt LLM with symbolic variants to get clearer rule inference.  

---

## Phase 3: Rule-to-Code Synthesis

### Step 5: Rule Parser  
- Extract key terms from LLM response:  
  - "mirror", "repeat", "swap", "rotate"  
- Build structured rule representation  

### Step 6: Code Synthesizer  
- Converts natural language rule into Python function  
- Uses templates like:  
  - mirror_rows  
  - tile_horizontally  
  - rotate_clockwise  
  - move_down  
- Generates clean code from parsed rule  

Example:  
If LLM says: “Repeat rows thrice then flip alternate ones”, synthesize:

```python
def transform(grid):
    row1 = grid\[0\] * 3  
    row2 = grid\[1\] * 3  
    return \[  
        row1,  
        row2,  
        row1\[::-1\],  
        row2\[::-1\],  
        row1,  
        row2  
    \]
```

## Phase 4: Quality Control & Scoring

### Step 7: Output Validator  
- Compares predicted output vs expected  
- Returns score between 0 and 1  
- Flags mismatches  

### Step 8: Feedback Engine  
- If score < 1\.0 → send feedback to analyzer  
- Suggest trying another symbolic variant  
- May re-prompt LLM with emoji or arrows instead of katakana  

---

## Phase 5: Iteration Loop

### Step 9: Iteration Manager  
- Tracks which symbolic sets have been tried  
- Tries new ones if current one fails  
- Builds confidence over time  

Example flow:  
1\. First iteration: uses Runic → gets partial rule  
2\. Second iteration: uses Arrows → clarifies motion logic  
3\. Third iteration: uses Katakana → confirms final output structure  

Each symbolic variant helps refine understanding.

---

## Phase 6: Puzzle Type Classifier

### Step 10: Build Classifier  
- Heuristic-based or ML model  
- Detects likely puzzle type from input/output pair  

Example:  
Given:  
Input: \[\[0, 1\], \[2, 0\]\]  
Output: \[\[2, 0\], \[0, 1\]\]  

Classifier returns: "vertical_swap"  

Symbol mapper picks best set (e.g., arrows)  

Mapped:  
Input:  
🟥 ⬇️  
⬇️ 🟦  

Output:  
⬇️ 🟥  
🟦 ⬇️  

LLM sees directional swap clearly.

---

## Phase 7: Testing & Evaluation

### Step 11: Run End-to-End Tests  
- Try GridGlyph on real ARC puzzles  
- Measure success rate  
- Track symbolic sets that improve accuracy  

### Step 12: Benchmark Across Models  
- GPT-4 / Claude / Mistral  
- Phi-3 / TinyT5 / Llama 3  

See which models benefit most from symbolic abstraction  

---

## Phase 8: Advanced Features (Optional)

### Step 13: Add Dynamic Symbol Swapping  
- On failure → auto-generate new symbolic version  
- Let LLM re-analyze with fresh cues  

### Step 14: Chain-of-Thought Templates  
- Pre-defined CoT examples per rule type  
- Insert them into prompts dynamically  

### Step 15: Symbolic Grammar Rules  
- Teach the agent to recognize common transformation patterns  
- E.g., "if mirrored rows appear, look for reverse_row() function"  

---

## Phase 9: Export as Reusable Tools

### Step 16: Package as LangChain Tools  
- SymbolMapperTool  
- RuleInferenceTool  
- CodeSynthesizerTool  
- GridExecutorTool  
- ScorerTool  
- FeedbackEngineTool  

### Step 17: Build CLI Interface  
- Run `gridglyph solve --puzzle my_puzzle.json`  
- Get rule description + Python function + test output  

### Step 18: Export Full Dataset  
- Generate thousands of symbolic puzzles  
- With known rules  
- Ready for training or prompting
