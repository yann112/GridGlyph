# GridGlyph Project Introduction

## What is GridGlyph?

GridGlyph is a novel approach to solving ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) puzzles through symbolic abstraction. Instead of processing raw numeric grids, the system converts visual puzzles into meaningful symbolic representations that help small language models understand spatial transformations more effectively.

## The Core Problem

ARC puzzles require understanding visual patterns and spatial transformations. Traditional approaches struggle because:
- Raw numbers (0, 1, 2, 3...) don't convey spatial or visual meaning
- Large language models process these as abstract tokens rather than geometric concepts
- The gap between numeric representation and visual reasoning is too large

## The GridGlyph Solution

**Symbolic Abstraction**: Convert numeric grids to semantic symbols (katakana characters, directional arrows, geometric symbols) that naturally suggest their spatial properties and transformations.

**Example Transformation**:
```
Numeric Grid:        Symbolic Grid (Katakana):
[[1, 2],            ア カ
 [3, 4]]       →    ウ エ
```

When an LLM sees `ア カ / ウ エ`, it's processing symbols with inherent visual meaning rather than abstract numbers.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
GridGlyph uses a custom DSL with 40+ symbolic commands:

**Spatial Operations**:
- `↔` : Horizontal flip
- `↕` : Vertical flip  
- `⮝` : Row shift operations
- `⮞` : Column shift operations

**Pattern Operations**:
- `▦` : Generate specific grid patterns
- `⧈` : Crop to non-zero regions
- `⏚` : Invert specific values
- `◎` : Isolate specific values

**Logical Operations**:
- `≡` : Equality comparison
- `¬` : Logical NOT
- `∧` : Logical AND
- `∨` : Logical OR

**Composition Operations**:
- `⟹` : Sequential application
- `⧎` : Conditional execution
- `¿` : If-then logic
- `◫` : Pattern-based transformation

### 2. Symbol Mapping System
- Converts numpy arrays to symbolic text representations
- Supports multiple symbol sets (katakana optimal for spatial reasoning)
- 10 different symbolic mappings for training diversity

### 3. Execution Engine
- DSL interpreter converts symbolic rules to executable Python functions
- Scoring system validates solutions against expected outputs
- Complete pipeline from symbolic rule to grid transformation

## Current Status

### Completed Infrastructure
- **40+ DSL Commands**: Full symbolic language for grid transformations
- **121 Atomic Test Cases**: Hand-validated foundational operations
- **Execution Pipeline**: DSL → Python → Grid transformation → Validation
- **Real Puzzle Solutions**: Successfully solved 5 hard ARC puzzles
- **1000 Complex Rules**: Generated sophisticated transformation rules

### Training Data Strategy
- **Atomic Foundation**: 121 × 50 derivations × 10 symbol mappings = 60,500 examples
- **Specialized Grids**: Each complex rule paired with minimal, focused demonstration grids
- **Quality Focus**: No noise, every example manually validated for correctness

### Model Training Plan
- **Target**: Qwen 0.5B (efficient, focused on structured symbolic task)
- **Task**: Grid → Rule prediction using symbolic representations
- **Approach**: LoRA fine-tuning with extended vocabulary for DSL symbols
- **Resources**: Kaggle 4×4 GPU setup for parallel training

## Example DSL Rules

**Simple Operations**:
```
"↔" : [[1,2],[3,4]] → [[2,1],[4,3]]  # Horizontal flip
"⇒(I,∅)" : [[1,0],[1,1]] → [[0,0],[0,0]]  # Replace 1s with 0s
```

**Complex Compositions**:
```
"⟹(⇒(∅, IV), ∧(◎(∅), ¬(⏚(∅))), Ⳁ)" 
# Replace zeros with 4s, AND with (isolate zeros AND NOT invert zeros), else identity
```

**Conditional Logic**:
```
"¿(↔, ≗(⊡(I,I), ⊕(I,I,V)))"
# If top-left equals constant 5, then horizontal flip, else identity
```

## Research Contributions

1. **Symbolic Spatial Reasoning**: Demonstrates that semantic symbols improve LLM understanding of geometric transformations
2. **Systematic Rule Foundation**: Shows value of building complex reasoning from validated atomic operations
3. **Efficient Architecture**: Achieves strong performance with small, focused models vs. large general-purpose ones
4. **Multi-Perspective Training**: Proves diverse symbolic representations enhance pattern generalization

## Key Advantages

- **Interpretable**: Every transformation has a clear symbolic trace
- **Efficient**: Small model (0.5B parameters) vs. massive LLMs
- **Grounded**: Symbols map directly to executable functions
- **Systematic**: Built from hand-validated atomic operations
- **Specialized**: Focused training data, no noise or irrelevant patterns

## Current Challenge

The main bottleneck is generating meaningful grid examples for the 1000 complex rules. Each rule needs 5-10 minimal demonstration grids that clearly show the transformation logic without extraneous noise or patterns.

## Usage Context

This document introduces GridGlyph for:
- **Technical discussions** about symbolic reasoning approaches
- **Collaboration** on ARC puzzle solving strategies  
- **Code generation** assistance for DSL operations or training pipeline
- **Research conversations** about the intersection of symbolic AI and spatial reasoning

GridGlyph represents a fundamentally different approach to puzzle solving - one that bridges the gap between visual reasoning and language model capabilities through meaningful symbolic abstraction.
