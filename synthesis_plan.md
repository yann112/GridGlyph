# ARC Solver — Program Synthesis Focused Plan

## Objective
Develop a program synthesis system in Python to automatically generate transformation programs that solve ARC puzzles by mapping input grids to output grids.

---

## Generic Plan: Synthesis-Centric Approach

### 1. Design a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
- Define a minimal but expressive language to represent grid transformations, such as:  
  - Selecting regions by color or shape  
  - Geometric transforms (translate, rotate, flip)  
  - Color modifications  
  - Cell-wise operations and compositions  
- The DSL should be easy to interpret and execute on grids.

### 2. Implement a Program Interpreter / Executor
- Build an interpreter that applies DSL programs to input grids and produces output grids.  
- Include error checking and output validation.

### 3. Develop a Search / Synthesis Engine
- Create a system that enumerates or searches DSL programs, aiming to find one that transforms the input grid to the output grid.  
- Use strategies like:  
  - Enumerative search by increasing program length  
  - Pruning using difference masks or partial evaluation  
  - Heuristic-guided search or constraint solving (optional)

### 4. Incorporate Program Ranking and Validation
- Score candidate programs by correctness and simplicity (e.g., minimal size).  
- Validate candidates on all given examples per puzzle.

### 5. Build a Modular Pipeline for ARC Puzzles
- For each puzzle:  
  - Extract input/output grids  
  - Run synthesis to generate candidate programs  
  - Select best program(s) and apply them to unseen inputs if any  
  - Evaluate success

# ARC Solver — Step-by-Step Synthesis Approach

## Step 1: DSL Design and Grid Representation

- Define the DSL primitives for transformations (e.g., `select_color(c)`, `translate(dx, dy)`, `fill_color(c)`).  
- Implement grid representation as 2D NumPy arrays.

**Deliverable:** DSL specification and grid data structure ready.

---

## Step 2: Implement DSL Interpreter

- Write functions that apply DSL commands to grids.  
- Ensure chaining/composition of commands is supported.

**Deliverable:** Interpreter that takes a program (list/tree of commands) and an input grid, outputs transformed grid.

---

## Step 3: Difference Mask and Heuristic Pruning

- Implement functions to compute difference masks between input and output grids.  
- Use these masks to prune program search space (e.g., only transform regions with differences).

**Deliverable:** Pruning heuristics to reduce search complexity.

---

## Step 4: Enumerative Program Synthesis Engine

- Build a generator that enumerates all possible DSL programs up to a certain length/complexity.  
- Apply pruning heuristics at each generation step to discard unlikely candidates.  
- Test candidate programs on the input grid to check if output matches.

**Deliverable:** Search engine capable of returning candidate programs that solve simple puzzles.

---

## Step 5: Program Ranking and Selection

- Implement scoring based on correctness (exact match) and program simplicity.  
- Select the best candidate program for each puzzle.

**Deliverable:** Ranking system to identify best transformation program.

---

## Step 6: Integration and Testing on ARC Puzzle Set

- Run the synthesis pipeline on a subset of ARC puzzles.  
- Evaluate accuracy and runtime performance.  
- Document failures for improvement.

**Deliverable:** Baseline solver with measurable results on simple puzzles.

---

## Optional Future Steps

- Introduce constraint solvers or SMT solvers to speed up synthesis.  
- Add heuristic or learned guidance to prioritize promising program paths.  
- Extend DSL expressivity while managing search complexity.  
- Incorporate meta-learning to generalize across puzzles.
