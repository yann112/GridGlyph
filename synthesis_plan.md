I am working on building a program synthesis system to solve ARC puzzles. The synthesis engine needs to be able to generate and test programs that transform input grids into output grids. 

My goal is to build a flexible synthesis engine that can work at multiple levels: grid-level transformations like RepeatGrid and FlipGrid, row/column-level combinators like Alternate(first, second), and pixel-level functions such as "flip if row index is odd". 

The core design principles are modularity, strategy awareness, hybrid transformation support (DSL + function-based), extensibility, and testability. 

Here is my step-by-step plan for the synthesis engine: 

Step 1: Define supported transformation types including Identity, FlipGridHorizontally, RepeatGrid, Alternate, and FunctionBasedTransformation. Each should have a describe method and synthesis rules metadata to guide search. 

Step 2: Implement a DSL interpreter that can execute any valid transformation tree using command.execute(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray. This includes logging, shape validation, and error handling. 

Step 3: Enhance the synthesis engine to support both DSL node enumeration and dynamic generation of pixel-level Python functions. It should score candidates based on match quality and use analysis insights to guide search. 

Key features include hybrid synthesis (try both DSL and function-based programs), dynamic arity combinators like Alternate, strategy-guided search using embedded hints, and confidence scoring using exact match or symbolic logic. 

Step 4: Add support for nested transformations like RepeatGrid(Alternate(...)) up to depth 2–3. This requires dynamic arity handling via synthesis_rules["arity"], combination generation using itertools.product, and structured logging of all tried combinations. 

Step 5: Improve candidate scoring by moving beyond simple cell-match ratio. Consider structural similarity, program complexity (prefer short programs), and optional symbolic verification using Z3. 

Step 6: Integrate with the orchestrator so the synthesis engine responds to strategy hints like pattern_focus, transformation_focus, and hybrid_focus. 

Deliverables include strategy-aware synthesis, compatibility with existing orchestrator interface, and clear tool wrapper support. 

Step 7: Write comprehensive tests that verify basic transformations work, combinator nesting works, function-based transformations work, and strategy hints improve success rate. Logs of all attempted programs should be generated and test coverage expanded. 

Optional future steps include Z3 constraint verification, LLM-guided synthesis, dynamic strategy switching, and learned heuristics to determine what works best for certain patterns. 

File structure will eventually be:
arc_solver/
core/
dsl_nodes.py
dsl_interpreter.py
synthesis_engine.py
tests/
test_synthesis_engine.py 

Summary table:
Step 1: Define transformation language → DSL primitives
Step 2: Execute DSL programs → Working interpreter
Step 3: Try grid + pixel-level logic → Enumeration + function support
Step 4: Nest transformations → Alternate, RepeatGrid
Step 5: Confidence scoring → Enhanced scoring system
Step 6: Connect to full system → Tool wrapper compatibility
Step 7: Validate correctness → Expanded test suite
